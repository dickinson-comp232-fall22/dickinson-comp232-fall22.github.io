<!-- * In addition, please fill out the [official feedback -->
<!-- form](https://dickinson.campuslabs.com/courseeval) if you have not -->
<!-- done so already. -->

<!-- Today's topic: depth-first and breadth-first graph traversals. -->

<!-- PowerPoint: -->
<!-- [intuitive-graph-traversals.pptx](class23/intuitive-graph-traversals.pptx) -->

<!-- Handout: [graph-traversals-handout.pdf](class23/graph-traversals-handout.pdf) -->

<!-- Handout solution: [graph-traversals-handout-solution.pdf](class23/graph-traversals-handout-solution.pdf) -->


<!-- ## Class 22 -->

<!-- Please fill out the [official feedback -->
<!-- form](https://dickinson.campuslabs.com/courseeval) for the -->
<!-- course (we will do this in class time). -->

<!-- Today's topic: graphs, including adjacency matrices and adjacency -->
<!-- lists. -->

<!-- PowerPoint: [class22-graphs.pptx](class22/class22-graphs.pptx) -->

## Class 21

Today's topic: Java Stream API. Java code: [streamdemo.zip](class21/streamdemo.zip).

## Class 20

Main topics for today: functional programming and lambda
expressions. We may also begin on the [Java Stream API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/18/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/package-summary.html).

This class and the next one will closely follow the corresponding
textbook chapter, which is available for download as a Word document
or PDF file.

Code: [functionAsParam.py](class20/functionAsParam.py),
[FunctionParameterDemo.java](class20/FunctionParameterDemo.java), [streamdemo.zip](class21/streamdemo.zip)

To run Python code without installing anything,
[repl.it](https://repl.it) is a good option.

Purely for interest: If you are curious about where the "lambda" in
lambda-expressions comes from... The use of the Greek letter lambda to
represent an anonymous function was first introduced by Alonzo Church
in his 1936 paper "[An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number
Theory](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9327%28193604%2958%3A2%3C345%3AAUPOEN%3E2.0.CO%3B2-1)",
American Journal of Mathematics, Vol. 58, No. 2. (Apr., 1936),
pp. 345-363. This paper is one of two that are most closely linked
with the birth of computer science as an academic discipline. The
other is Alan Turing's paper on computable numbers, also from 1936. To
find out more, take COMP314.


## Class 19

Hash tables, session II. We continue with the PowerPoint, Java files,
and handout from last time.

As part of our discussion of a few computer scientists, it's well
worth checking out [Joy
Buolamwini](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/joyab/overview/)'s
[poetofcode.com](https://poetofcode.com/) site, especially her video art "[AI,
Ain't I A Woman](https://youtu.be/QxuyfWoVV98)."

## Class 18

Hash tables, session I.

PowerPoint: [class18-hash-tables.pptx](class18/class18-hash-tables.pptx)

Java: [HashCodes.java](class18/HashCodes.java) and
[ComputerScientist.java](class18/ComputerScientist.java)

Handout: [hash-table-handout.pdf](class18/hash-table-handout.pdf) (and the [handout solution](class18/hash-table-handout-solution.pdf))


## Class 17b

Exam review session. Please bring any questions.

<!-- Also, we will go over stable sorting again, using an updated -->
<!-- explanation. -->

<!-- As previously announced, homework assignment 6 will be graded on -->
<!-- completeness only. Solutions are being made available today. Unlike -->
<!-- most other homework assignments, you may consult the solutions when -->
<!-- working on this assignment. To benefit as much as possible from the -->
<!-- assignment, you should make a serious attempt at each question before -->
<!-- consulting the solution. -->


## Class 17

Note the announcement of midterm exam 2. Also note that homework six
will be graded on completeness only, and can optionally be turned in
before the exam or after the exam.

Topics:
* Heap sort
* Stability of sorting algorithms
* Example of real-world sorting algorithm

PowerPoint: [class17-heap-sort.pptx](class17/class17-heap-sort.pptx)



## Class 16

Sorting algorithms: Today we study *insertion sort* and *merge
sort*. Next time we study *heap sort*. Note that the textbook also
discusses *selection sort* and mentions *bubble sort* and *quick
sort*. It is good to read about and be aware of selection sort and
bubble sort but we do not study them in detail.

We've seen this before:
* [fun link comparing sorting algorithm running
  times](http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/random-initial-order)

Powerpoint: [class16-insertion-and-merge-sort.pptx](class16/class16-insertion-and-merge-sort.pptx) <font
     color="red">[UPDATED 10/31/2022]</font>

Important basic fact: [sum-of-1-to-n.pdf](class16/sum-of-1-to-n.pdf)

## Class 15


Topics for today (all optional, not on the exam or homework):
  1. Climate symposium discussion (and [NYTimes article on the Merge at Ethereum](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/technology/what-is-the-merge.html))
  1. Generic expressions like `CS232PriorityQueue<K extends Comparable<K>, V>`
     - These are called *bounded type parameters*. See [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/bounded.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/bounded.html)
  1. AVL trees, or balanced trees generally.
     * [description](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs225/fa2021/resources/avl-trees/)
	 * [demo](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html)
	 * other balanced trees that are used in practice:
	   - [red-black trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree)
	   - [B-trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree)
  1. Javadoc demo
     * check out the Project \| Generate Javadoc... command in Eclipse.
  
Help and discussion of homework 5 (bring your own questions)


## Class 14

* [Results of midsemester feedback](class14/COMP232-mid-semester-feedback-fall2022.pdf)
* Main topic: **heaps**
  - [PowerPoint slides for heaps](class14/class14-heaps-slides.pptx)

Next time:
Help and discussion of homework 5 (bring your own questions)


## Class 13

* Please complete the [mid-semester survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=VbAyYrl2E0ybiLVirn22-3zmolgc6htDs2E7F-Dz3zdUMUs5WjFNUzZRT001Nk40RlhYVDRWUTQzQSQlQCN0PWcu)

* Main topic for today: binary search trees (BSTs)
  - **Important note:** In the textbook, equal keys are stored in the
    *left* child. In the CS232 sample code, equal keys are stored in the
    *right* child. For the homework, you must store equal keys in the
    *right* child, not the left child.
  - three BST operations:
    * `find` (also called `get`)
	* `add` (also called `insert`)
	* `remove`: 3 cases to remove node N
	  - zero children (easy: remove N)
	  - one child (easy: promote N's child to N's position)
	  - two children (harder: swap in value from smallest node S in right
        subtree of N, then call remove on S)
  - [PowerPoint slides describing the three BST operations](class13/class13-BSTs.pptx)
  - [handout to practice adding and removing BST nodes](class13/bst-handout.png)
  - [handout solution](class13/bst-handout-solution.png)


## Class 12

Binary trees session 2. Today's topics:
1. Definitions of full and complete binary trees; and also perfect binary trees
1. Statement of two theorems about binary trees (low importance -- see textbook)
1. Very important theorem about perfect binary trees: 
   * a perfect binary tree of height h has 2^(h+1)-1 nodes (required
     knowledge, not in textbook, see powerpoint from previous class
     meeting).
   * therefore, any <font color="red">complete</font> binary tree with
     n nodes has height in O(log n) -- also required knowledge. <font
     color="red">[UPDATED 10/20/2022]</font>
   * details are available in the [Binary tree PowerPoint
     notes](class11/topic5-binary-trees.pptx) from the previous class
     meeting.
<!-- 1. Review traversals -->
<!--    - Examine the code for level order traversal, which uses a queue -->
<!--      rather than employing recursion. -->
<!-- 1. Review binary tree ADT, and compare with the Map ADT -->
1. Overview of the Visitor design pattern (see sample code
   `tree.PrintVisitor.java` for an example). Additional examples of
   the Visitor pattern (**very** useful for the binary tree homework
   assignment):
   - [SumVisitor.java](class12/SumVisitor.java)
   - [AverageWithoutLowestVisitor.java](class12/AverageWithoutLowestVisitor.java)
1. Homework help for the binary tree homework assignment
   - [Hints for HW4, question 6](class12/hw4-qu6-hints.png)

A useful example of how to add methods that assist in debugging your
code: [BTNode.java](class12/BTNode.java)

<!-- Resources: -->
<!-- * [whiteboard notes](class12/whiteboard-class12.png) &ndash; including updated list of nodes traversed for the warm-up example at the start -->


## Class 11

Binary trees session 1. Today's topics:
* Basic definitions (root, leaves, internal loads, descendants,
  ancestors, depth, height, path length).
* recursive nature of binary trees
* Four types of traversals: Level order, pre-order, in order, post-order.
* Our ADT for Binary trees

Resources:
* [Binary tree PowerPoint notes](class11/topic5-binary-trees.pptx)   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="red">UPDATED AGAIN on 10/20/2022</font>

For next time:
* Make a start on the binary tree homework assignment (HW4). Try to
  look through all the questions and highlight areas where you need a
  hint to get started. In the next class meeting, we will spend some
  time giving hints where necessary.


## Exam review session

Please bring any questions for material you would like to review before the exam.

* Review of stacks and queues: [stacks-and-queues-review.pptx](class10b/stacks-and-queues-review.pptx)

* If interested, read about a [Canvas bug that is consuming CPU in browsers](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Question-Forum/Canvas-taking-high-CPU-using-Chrome/m-p/538865/thread-id/177761/page/2) (this affects our textbook).

* Don't forget, HW3 will be graded only on completeness, not
  correctness. The solutions are available on Moodle.

* Useful tip for adding Javadoc to a class, method, or constructor in
  Eclipse: use Generate Element Comment from the Source menu. After
  writing your comments, use Format Element in the same menu to fix
  formatting.

<!-- * [PowerPoint notes](class10b/class10b-review-session.pptx) -->
