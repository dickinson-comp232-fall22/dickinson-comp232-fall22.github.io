# Detailed schedule

## Class 7

Review of algorithm analysis topic.

* [SayHi.java](class07/SayHi.java)
* [handout](class07/class7-handout.pdf) for practising asymptotic
  analysis from first principles


## Class 6

Formal definition of big-O, big-omega, big-theta. Solving recurrence
relations via expansion.

* [whiteboard notes](class06/class06-whiteboard.png)



## Class 5

Overview of asymptotic running times, especially big-O.

* [fun link comparing sorting algorithm running times](http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/random-initial-order)
* [whiteboard notes](class05/class5-whiteboard.png)


## Class 4

*Backtracking* and its connection to recursion, via *recursion trees*.

* [PermutationsIncomplete.java](class04/PermutationsIncomplete.java)
* [subsets recursion tree](class04/subsets-recursion-tree.png) &ndash; fill this in for the recursion homework assignment
* [whiteboard notes](class04/whiteboard-notes.pptx)

## Class 3

Some more sophisticated examples of recursion, including `isReverse()`
from the textbook and the following two examples based on COMP232
sample code:
* [SubsetsIncomplete.java](class03/SubsetsIncomplete.java)
* [SplitArrayIncomplete.java](class03/SplitArrayIncomplete.java)


## Class 2

Elementary examples of recursion, using the coding examples in the
textbook.



## Class 1

Overview of the course.

Review: install Eclipse, create and run a Java program.
