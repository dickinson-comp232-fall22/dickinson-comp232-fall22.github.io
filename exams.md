# Exams

As stated on the syllabus:
    
> The midterm and final exams are open note and open web. Students may
> consult any printed or digital materials and may perform web
> searches. However, no communication with other humans is permitted.  
> ...  
> Technically speaking, any material covered in any lecture, reading,
> or homework assignment is eligible to appear in the midterm or final
> exams. In practice, a strong majority of exam questions will be
> similar to a homework question, an example done in class, or other
> assigned practice questions.

Following is some additional clarification of the above syllabus
statements. Students are encouraged to use all appropriate tools,
including Eclipse, web searches, and existing content on programming
websites and forums. However, it is not permitted to seek help from
other humans either directly or via an online forum.

Exams will be provided in Microsoft Word format.

Exam solutions should be submitted to GitHub using the same
methodology as for homework assignments: answers that involve writing
source code are pushed to the relevant Java files in GitHub; non-code
answers are inserted into a PDF document which is pushed to the
`noncode-answers` directory in GitHub. Non-code answers may include
handwritten solutions that have been scanned or photographed.

<font color="green">The number of points allocated to a question
indicates approximately how many minutes it would take a well-prepared
student to complete that question. Example: a 5-point question should
take about five minutes to answer, assuming you have already mastered
all relevant concepts.</font>

Students with academic accommodations receive extra time in the
normal way. For example, if the stated time to submit the exam is 24
hours, a student who normally receives time-and-a-half for tests will
have 36 hours to complete the exam.


## Midterm Exam 1

Exam 1 covers material from Topics 1-4. The exam begins at the start
of class on the designated day of the exam (Thursday October 6,
2022). The exam will be of a length that could typically be completed
in a 75-minute class session. However, all students will have 24 hours
to complete and submit the exam to GitHub. 
<!-- Therefore, the deadline for submission is 1030am Eastern time on -->
<!-- 10/8/21. -->
Late submissions will be penalized by 5% per hour.

The exam can be downloaded from Moodle via a link that will become
active five minutes before the start of the exam.

Questions about the exam can be asked in person, or sent to the
instructor by email or Microsoft Teams. The instructor will make
reasonable efforts to respond in a timely fashion, but it is best to
ask any questions within the first 75 minutes of the exam to ensure a
timely response.

## Midterm Exam 2

The instructions for midterm exam 2 are the same as for midterm exam
1, except that:
* The exam covers material from Topics 5-7
<!-- * The exam begins at 10:30 AM on Thursday, November 11. The deadline -->
<!--   is 24 hours later: 10:30 AM on Friday, November 12. -->

## Final Exam

The instructions for the final exam are the same as for midterm exams, except that:
* The exam covers material from all topics, with extra emphasis on topics 8-10.
* Students have 48 hours to complete the take-home exam. The exam
  begins 48 hours before the official final exam slot, and the
  deadline to submit is the end of the official final exam slot.
