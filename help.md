# Ways to get help in this course

There are many ways of getting extra help in this course:
* post a question on our [Microsoft Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a7HaAd-3CvJbMkBy7TLQLlIBgk-hihiwZAYK0r2W3Np41%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=96925046-c230-4588-921e-163db6195356&tenantId=6232b055-76b9-4c13-9b88-b562ae7db6fb)
   - Don't be shy. It's fine to ask questions about the
     homework. Other students can provide hints. The instructor and
     the QRA may also give you hints.
* Meet with [Percy Pham, our QRA](qra.md)
* Go to the [Quantitative Reasoning Center](https://users.dickinson.edu/~jmac/qr-center.html)
* Go to the departmental [Computer Science Help Room](help-room/cs-help-room.md)
* Go to the [instructor's office hours](https://users.dickinson.edu/~jmac/office-hours.html)
