## Important notes about the textbook

* The textbook is assembled from materials provided for free by [OpenDSA](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/).

* The textbook is stored within the Canvas learning management system
  because that is the free format provided by OpenDSA. Canvas is a
  complete learning management system, just like Moodle, but we are
  not using any features of Canvas other than the textbook modules.

* Some parts of the textbook are set up as assignments. The
  assignments exist only because OpenDSA provides them by default. You
  are not required to complete the assignments. The automatic
  grading performed by Canvas will not affect your Dickinson grade in
  any way.

* This version of the textbook was assembled in fall 2021. The title
  of the book and the Canvas course reflect this. The fall 2021
  version of the book is the correct version to use for our current
  course.

## Offline version

An [offline version of the
textbook](textbook/data-structures-and-problem-solving.pdf) is
available. This offline version is provided as an additional
convenience, especially for working without Internet access. The
offline version has some disadvantages compared to the online version:
1. The offline version has many formatting problems, such as text and
   diagrams that do not fit on the page. No attempt has been made to
   correct these. Please consult the online version to see any content
   that is not visible due to formatting problems.
2. The offline version does not contain any of the dynamic examples
   available in the online version.
